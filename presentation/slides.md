PaaS S3 Broker
===

---

## S3 is here!

----

(In private beta)

---

## Current functionality
* Provision private S3 buckets
* Bind them to apps
* Store your objects
* Delete your buckets

---

A single set of credentials are configured per-binding, and removing the binding will remove that binding's user from the bucket.

---

Credentials to access the bucket are provided through an environment variable
